# Training-Index-Model-for-Security-Price-Prediction
Successfully completed a comprehensive course project under the guidance of Prof. Abhinava Tripathi (Nov '23), focusing on Security Price Prediction using Index Models. 
Key achievements include:

## Applied Machine Learning to Financial Data: 
Successfully utilized machine learning techniques for sentiment analysis, dividend announcements, and stock market predictions, showcasing expertise in handling extensive financial datasets over a 5-7 year period.

## Data Processing and Visualization Mastery: 
Proficiently managed data preprocessing, visualized trends, and performed statistical analyses. Expertly segregated data, compared key statistical metrics, and conducted comprehensive diagnostic tests on residuals and outliers.

## Robust Regression Modeling:
Engineered robust regression models, addressing heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation. Evaluated model performance using advanced statistical measures, providing insightful commentary on coefficient analysis, adjusted R-squared, and t/p values.

## Out-of-Sample Prediction Prowess: 
Conducted out-of-sample predictions on test datasets, comparing four distinct models—simple linear regression, non-linear regression with quadratic terms, multiple linear regression, and a naïve model. Established a machine learning system utilizing objective function parameters for optimal model selection in financial forecasting.
