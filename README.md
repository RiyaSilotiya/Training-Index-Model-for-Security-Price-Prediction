# Training-Index-Model-for-Security-Price-Prediction
Successfully completed a comprehensive course project under the guidance of Prof. Abhinava Tripathi (Nov '23), focusing on Security Price Prediction using Index Models. 
Key achievements include:

## Applied Machine Learning to Financial Data: 
Successfully implemented advanced machine learning techniques in the financial market, including the development of sentiment and dividend announcement dummy variables, training both simple linear and multiple linear regression models on historical stock and market data spanning 5-7 years.


## Data Processing and Visualization Mastery: 
 Demonstrated proficiency in data preprocessing, visualization, and statistical analysis by segregating data into training and test sets, examining density plots, comparing skewness, kurtosis, normality, and stationarity, and performing thorough residual diagnostics, outlier tests, heteroscedasticity, and autocorrelation tests.


## Robust Regression Modeling:
Engineered robust regression models, accounting for heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation, and explored non-linearity in predictive modeling by incorporating quadratic terms. Employed various statistical measures, such as coefficient analysis, adjusted R-squared, t/p values, to assess and comment on model performance.

## Out-of-Sample Prediction Prowess: 
 Executed out-of-sample predictions on test datasets using four distinct models—simple linear regression, non-linear regression with quadratic terms, multiple linear regression, and a naïve model. Calculated and compared various error measures, leading to the establishment of a machine learning system that leverages objective function parameters for model selection in financial forecasting.
